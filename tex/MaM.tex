The RAM legacy database was used to simulate data-poor datasets and then a catch-only method based on a biomass dynamic model was used to estimate stock status relative to $MSY$ reference points, and compared to the original data-rich estimates. %This allowed the Value-of-Information (VoI) to be evaluated, i.e. which is more important for determining bias and precision, the data or expert knowledge?
The objective is to evaluate the ability of data-poor methods to identify system state relative to targets reference points based on $MSY$. To do this we use Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves  \citep{green1966signal}
